# Food-Delivery-Time-Prediction

## Description

To predict the food delivery time in real-time, we need to calculate the distance between the food preparation point and the point of food consumption.

This project predicts the time taken of deliverys, using the following parameters.

Distance - Time Taken - Age - Ratings


## Frameworks
1. Python.
2. Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning.
3. Plotly Express for data visualization.
4. Scikit-learn for model building.
5. TensorFlow-Keras.
6. Jupyter notebook.

## How to run?

1. Install [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install) --> 'pip install notebook'
2. Execute the code
3. Complete the input at the end :
